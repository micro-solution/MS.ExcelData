Please be aware that some descriptions will come directly from the API's documentation because no further explanations were needed for the specific method. Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, I will use the following convention along with the whole document: 

```c#
using EOD;
// create the instance of the SDK
apiToken = "YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE";
var _api = new API(apiToken);
```
